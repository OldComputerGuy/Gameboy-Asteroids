The source code I provide must not be used for commercial purposes, it is for educational purposes only, this can be considered fair use. I would also ask you not to redistribute any of the code found here. The copyrights to all code are reserved, any trademarks, brands or other properties not relating to the source codes are the property of their respective owners, for instance the name 'Mortal K*mbat' does not belong to me, the source code to the game does, the code in it's compile binary form (the ROM) maybe someone elses property. Hope that makes things clear.

Only the games assembly language files are include, there are no graphic files included.

The ASM file were assembled in a custom gameboy assembler, and tested in a custom emulator written back in 1999.
